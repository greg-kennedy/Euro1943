Bugs to fix:

* SERVER - probably should not set i=MAXPLAYERS - may delay dropping players
* SERVER - unexpected crash when blowing too many things up?

* CLIENT - should probably not connect to a server without getting an ACK

Things to polish:
(13:24:24) Greg Kennedy: or clouds that appear when you get airborne
(13:24:39) Greg Kennedy: or colored polygons that shoot out when a vehicle is blown apart
Parachutes (sprites already checked in)
Battleship smoke trails
All those todos, like collision sounds
Vehicle engine sounds
screen shake when explosions occur
Change explosion damage to distance-based, (instead of instakill on hit players) and allow friendlyfire explosions
