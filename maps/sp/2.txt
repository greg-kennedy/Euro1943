20  0 Now, you can swim out there if you want...
40  0 but I'll be deploying some ships and planes
60  0   so you can stay dry instead.
80  0 Do be careful when getting airborne,
100 0 the controls are touchy.  Use the mouse to
101 0   steer yourself.  And make sure to avoid
120 0   trees when you're on the ground, too.
140 1 Aye, sir!
180 0 Once we get across the pond, the way is cleared
181 0   to the primary target: a secret German lab.
200 0 Intelligence reports that some pretty gruesome
201 0   experiments are being done there.
220 0 Rangers will storm the lab and rescue the...
240 0 uh... the test subjects.
280 1 I could not feel more *pride* for my country.
300 1 The army's clearly doing the right thing here.
