1   0 Today we're attacking the enemy by land.
20  0 Since we have a wide area to cover,
40  0 I will provide you with vehicles for support.
60  0 Enter a vehicle with the ENTER key
61  0   or the middle mouse button.
80  0 Use the mouse and keys to control or fire.
100 0 Do be careful not to drive them into a lake.
140 0 The enemy is holding prisoners captive in a
141 0   camp beyond their HQ.
160 0 If we hold this area, we can liberate the
161 0   hapless prisoners with ease.
180 1 Well, that's certainly a noble goal...
200 0 You're damn right son.  Uncle Sam cares about
201 0   the REAL victims of this war.
220 1 ...I feel *proud* to serve my country!
